#  Likelihood of E-Signing a Loan Analysis

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook (likelihood.ipynb) focuses on analyzing a dataset related to e-signing of loans. The dataset (P39-Financial-Data.csv) includes various features such as age, pay schedule, home ownership status, income, risk scores, and the target variable indicating whether the loan was e-signed. The goal is to build and evaluate machine learning models to predict the likelihood of e-signing a loan. The notebook primarily covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.
